# CIIO Root Template for GitHub Projects

Language-agnostic educational project template for **Cyber Security**, **Intelligence**, and **Information Operations** (CIIO). This repository provides a structured foundation for instructors to develop GitHub Classroom assignments and other projects using **Python**, **C/C++**, or **x86/64 Assembly (NASM)**. It integrates **Docker** for containerization and **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration, facilitating best practices in software development and DevOps.

Language-specific templates and example [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) assignments will follow throughout Fall 2024. In the meantime, instructors can fork this repository to create new assignments, labs, or projects for students. The template includes directories for code, data, documentation, and tests, as well as essential files like `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `LICENSE`. It also provides a `DOCKER.md` guide for building and running Docker containers, ensuring a consistent development environment across platforms.

If you or your students are not familiar with Git or GitHub, see the [GitHub Starter Course](https://github.com/ciio-ai/github-starter-course).
