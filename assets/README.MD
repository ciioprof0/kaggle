# assets/

This directory is intended to store non-code resources used throughout the project. These assets can include images, configuration files, models, multimedia, and other auxiliary files that support your code and documentation.

## Purpose

The `assets/` directory helps organize and separate media and resource files from your source code (`src/`) and documentation (`docs/`). By keeping these files in a dedicated directory, you maintain a clean project structure and make it easier to manage and locate necessary resources.

## Usage Examples

### Cyber Operations

- **Network Diagrams**: Store images of network architectures or security infrastructure diagrams used in reports or presentations.
- **Configuration Files**: Include sample or default configuration files for security tools (e.g., firewall settings, intrusion detection systems).
- **Multimedia**: Store videos or images related to cyber operations demonstrations, training, or presentations.

### Intelligence and Information Operations

- **Language Resources**: Save lexicons, dictionaries, or other resources used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Store machine learning models (e.g., `.h5`, `.pt` files) used for text analysis or classification (if they are not too large).
- **Multimedia Files**: Include audio recordings, videos, or images relevant to Human Language Technology (HLT) applications.

### General Use

- **Images**: Store any images that are used in the project, such as logos, diagrams, and illustrations for documentation or presentations.
- **Scripts**: Keep auxiliary scripts or tools that assist in non-core project functions but are still important for understanding the system.
- **Icons and Templates**: Store visual elements used in user interfaces or documentation templates.

## Guidelines

- **Organization**: You can create subdirectories within `assets/` for better organization, such as `assets/images/`, `assets/config/`, or `assets/models/`.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive filenames to make it easy to identify the purpose of each asset.
- **Version Control Considerations**:
  - **Large Files**: Avoid committing large files to the repository. Consider using Git Large File Storage (LFS) or providing download links for large models or multimedia files.
  - **Sensitive Data**: Do not include any sensitive or confidential information. Use placeholders or anonymized assets if necessary.
- **Documentation**: If you add assets, update relevant documentation to explain their usage and importance.

## Best Practices

- **Licensing**: Ensure you have the right to use and distribute any third-party assets included in this directory.
- **Attribution**: Provide proper attribution for any external resources, following academic and legal standards.
- **Maintenance**: Regularly review the contents of the `assets/` directory to remove outdated or unnecessary files.
