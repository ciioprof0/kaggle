# data/

This directory is designated for storing datasets and corpora used in the project. It helps maintain a clean and organized project structure by separating data-related files from code and other resources. This directory is essential for data analysis, machine learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and other data-driven tasks.

## Purpose

The `data/` directory is specifically intended for storing structured and unstructured data used in computational tasks such as training models, testing algorithms, or conducting analyses. This includes both raw and processed data.

## Structure

It is recommended to organize the `data/` directory into subdirectories based on the type and state of the data:

```plaintext
data/
├── raw/          # Original, unprocessed datasets
├── processed/    # Cleaned and processed datasets ready for analysis
```

### Suggested Subdirectories

- **`raw/`**: Store raw, unaltered data obtained from external sources. These files should remain unchanged and can serve as the baseline for future data processing.
- **`processed/`**: Store datasets that have been cleaned, transformed, or preprocessed for use in experiments or model training.

## Usage Examples

### Cyber Operations

- **Network Traffic Data**: Store network logs or packet capture (PCAP) files used for intrusion detection or anomaly detection tasks.
- **Security Logs**: Collect logs from firewalls, IDS/IPS, or other network devices for use in threat analysis.

### Intelligence and Information Operations

- **Text Corpora for NLP**: Store large corpora of text data (e.g., news articles, social media posts) for sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or language modeling.
- **Audio and Speech Data**: Keep corpora of recorded conversations or broadcasts for speech recognition or speaker identification tasks.
- **Sentiment and Topic Datasets**: Store datasets for sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or other computational linguistics tasks.

### Data Science Applications

- **Training and Testing Sets**: Store CSV, JSON, or other structured data formats for training machine learning models and testing their performance.
- **Statistical Data**: Store numerical datasets for regression, clustering, or classification tasks, including time series, tabular, or geospatial data.

## Guidelines

- **Data Privacy and Security**: Do not store sensitive or confidential information unless it has been properly anonymized. Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
- **Version Control Considerations**:
  - **Large Files**: Avoid committing large datasets directly to the Git repository. Instead, use Git Large File Storage (LFS) or provide links to external storage.
  - **Data Formats**: Use common and interoperable data formats like CSV, JSON, or XML for structured data, and ensure corpora follow recognized formats like `.txt`, `.conll`, or `.wav` for text and audio data.

## Best Practices

- **Document Data Sources**: In the `README.md` or other documentation, provide details about the data sources, licensing, and any preprocessing steps applied to the data.
- **Data Processing Pipelines**: Use scripts stored in `src/` to handle data processing and transformations. Ensure that raw data remains unchanged and all processing steps are reproducible.
- **External Data**: If datasets are too large to include in the repository, provide scripts or instructions in `docs/` for downloading and setting up the data (e.g., from public datasets or APIs).

## Example Dataset Description

If adding a dataset, you should include a brief description of its purpose and origin. For example:

```plaintext
Dataset: Network Traffic Logs
Source: Collected from a simulated environment of a medium-sized enterprise network.
Purpose: Used for training a machine learning model to detect anomalies in network traffic.
Size: 2GB (split into multiple files)
Location: data/raw/network_logs/
```

## Maintenance

- **Keep Data Updated**: Periodically review the datasets and corpora to ensure they remain relevant and up-to-date.
- **Organize by Project or Task**: If multiple datasets are being used for different tasks, consider further organizing subdirectories based on the specific projects or tasks.
