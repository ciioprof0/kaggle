# docs/

The `docs/` directory is intended for storing all documentation related to the application, including technical documentation, user guides, and any narrative reports or analysis derived from the application. This directory serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding, using, and maintaining the project.

## Purpose

The `docs/` directory provides a centralized location for project-related documentation, ensuring that both developers and users have easy access to essential information. This includes both technical details about the code and usage, as well as any narrative reports or analysis outputs generated by the application.

## Structure

You can organize the `docs/` directory into subdirectories to separate technical documentation, reports, and any other relevant materials:

```plaintext
docs/
├── api/           # API documentation (if applicable)
├── user-guides/   # User manuals or guides
├── reports/       # Generated narrative reports or analyses
├── diagrams/      # Architectural, workflow, or system diagrams
└── README.md      # Main index of the docs folder
```

### Suggested Subdirectories

- **`api/`**: Store auto-generated or manually created API documentation. This is especially useful for web-based applications or projects with a public API.
- **`user-guides/`**: Provide step-by-step guides or manuals for end-users, detailing how to install, configure, and use the application.
- **`reports/`**: Save narrative reports or analysis derived from running the application. This could include intelligence summaries, data analysis reports, or system evaluation documents.
- **`diagrams/`**: Store architectural diagrams, process workflows, and other visuals that explain the system's design and operation.

## Usage Examples

### Cyber Operations

- **Technical Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation on the design and structure of a network monitoring tool or other cyber operation applications, including explanations of key algorithms and technologies.
- **Reports**: Include analysis reports generated by the system, such as threat intelligence reports or incident response summaries.

### Intelligence and Information Operations

- **Narrative Reports**: Generate and store reports derived from NLP models, such as sentiment analysis or topic modeling results based on real-world data.
- **Language Model Documentation**: Include explanations of the models used in language processing applications, such as named entity recognition or machine translation, and how they are applied in operational environments.

### Data Science Applications

- **Statistical Analysis Reports**: Store detailed reports and visualizations from data science tasks, including model performance summaries, data exploration findings, and statistical analyses.
- **User Guides**: Provide user documentation for data scientists and analysts who need to use the application's data processing pipelines or machine learning models.

## Guidelines

- **Version Control**: Keep documentation up-to-date with the codebase. Whenever there are changes in the source code, make sure the documentation reflects those changes.
- **Formatting**: Use Markdown (`.md`), reStructuredText (`.rst`), or other structured formats that render well in web-based platforms like GitHub. You can also include PDF versions of more formal documents if needed.
- **Automated Documentation**: If applicable, use tools like Sphinx (for Python) or Doxygen (for C/C++) to auto-generate parts of your technical documentation and save them in this directory.

## Best Practices

- **Consistent Structure**: Ensure that all documentation follows a consistent structure, making it easy for users and developers to find the information they need.
- **Document Everything**: For complex applications, make sure to document every significant aspect of the system, including architecture, workflow, deployment, and troubleshooting guides.
- **Keep User Guides Simple**: Ensure that any user guides or manuals are written clearly and are accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.

## Example Files

Here are some examples of what you might store in each subdirectory:

- **`api/`**: API reference generated by tools like Swagger, detailing the endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms.
- **`user-guides/`**: A step-by-step installation guide for users deploying the application on different operating systems (e.g., Linux, Windows).
- **`reports/`**: A report generated by the system analyzing sentiment in social media posts or summarizing intelligence data.
- **`diagrams/`**: A system architecture diagram showing the flow of data through different components of the application.

## Example Documentation Description

When adding documentation files, you should include a brief description of their purpose and context. For example:

```plaintext
Document: Cyber Operations Tool User Guide
Purpose: This guide provides step-by-step instructions on installing, configuring, and using the network monitoring tool developed for cyber threat detection.
Location: docs/user-guides/cyber-ops-tool-guide.md
```
