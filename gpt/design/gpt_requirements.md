To create custom GPT design documents, align them with software development best practices while adjusting for the unique requirements of GPT development. Here is a breakdown of potential sections for the design documents:

## Requirements Specification

### Purpose
Outline the primary role and scope of the custom GPT.

### User Stories
Define the target users (e.g., students, customers) and their needs.

### Functional Requirements
Detail the GPT's core functions (e.g., conversational capabilities, knowledge management).

### Non-Functional Requirements
Address usability, performance, security, and privacy considerations.

## Behavior Design

### Base Context
Describe the initial context the GPT should adopt.

### Behavior Guidelines
Behavior Guidelines: Specify tone, level of formality, and handling of sensitive information.

### Prohibitions
List forbidden behaviors and responses.

### Handling Unknowns
Instructions for how the GPT should manage requests beyond its knowledge base.

## Process Flow:

### Interaction Flow
Diagram user interaction with the GPT, including refinements and handling of conversation starters.

### Error Handling
Outline responses to ambiguous, invalid, or prohibited queries.

## Knowledge Management

### Knowledge Sources
Identify and document external knowledge files and reference materials.

### Update Process
Describe how to maintain and update the knowledge base.

## Capability and Action Design

### Capabilities
Define and document each capability (e.g., web browsing, image generation), including constraints and prerequisites.

### Action Workflow
Detail the steps and authentication processes for each action, specifying privacy considerations.

## Testing and Validation

### Test Cases
Develop test cases to validate the GPT's behavior, responses, and interaction flow.

### Acceptance Criteria
Establish criteria for successful GPT behavior during user interactions.

These design documents will help ensure a thorough, structured approach to custom GPT development, supporting the creation of detailed instructions and configurations for the `gpt_config.yml` file.
