# notebooks/

This directory is intended for storing Jupyter notebooks or similar interactive computing files used for exploratory data analysis, prototyping, and documentation of research and experiments. Notebooks provide a flexible environment where code, visualizations, and markdown documentation can be combined to share insights and workflows.

## Purpose

The `notebooks/` directory serves as a workspace for interactive coding, particularly useful for data exploration, visualization, and experimentation. Jupyter notebooks are commonly used in cyber operations, intelligence, and information applications (such as NLP and HLT), and this directory provides a dedicated space for those activities.

## Usage Examples

### Cyber Operations

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use notebooks to explore network traffic, logs, or other datasets relevant to cybersecurity. Visualize patterns, identify anomalies, and prototype detection algorithms.
- **Security Experimentation**: Prototype and test security-related algorithms, such as cryptography functions or intrusion detection methods, in a notebook before integrating them into the main application.

### Intelligence and Information Operations

- **NLP Model Development**: Use notebooks to experiment with Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, including tokenization, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Document and run data preprocessing steps (such as cleaning, tokenization, or encoding) for text corpora used in information analysis applications.
- **Text and Audio Analysis**: Analyze textual and speech data for Human Language Technology (HLT) tasks like machine translation, speech recognition, or information extraction.

### Data Science Applications

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Perform and document analysis on structured datasets. Create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, or time-series graphs to explore trends in data.
- **Machine Learning Prototyping**: Use notebooks to prototype machine learning models, run experiments, and tune hyperparameters before transitioning the code into the main project.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of trained models, track metrics (accuracy, precision, recall), and generate confusion matrices or other validation visualizations.

## Structure

To keep the `notebooks/` directory organized, you can create subdirectories or use descriptive file names based on the specific use case or task:

```plaintext
notebooks/
├── eda/                # Exploratory Data Analysis notebooks
├── ml-prototyping/     # Machine learning model development
├── nlp-analysis/       # Notebooks focused on NLP tasks
└── README.md           # This readme file
```

### Suggested Subdirectories

- **`eda/`**: Store notebooks related to exploratory data analysis, such as visualizations or preliminary data studies.
- **`ml-prototyping/`**: Store machine learning model experimentation and prototyping notebooks.
- **`nlp-analysis/`**: Keep NLP-related notebooks, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or entity extraction experiments.

## Guidelines

- **Descriptive Naming**: Use descriptive names for notebooks (e.g., `network_traffic_analysis.ipynb`, `sentiment_analysis_experiment.ipynb`) to make it clear what each notebook focuses on.
- **Documentation**: Make sure to use markdown cells in the notebooks to explain the code, methodologies, and results. This makes your work easier to understand and share.
- **Version Control**: Keep in mind that notebooks can produce large output files (such as images or data). If needed, consider clearing outputs before committing to version control to reduce file size.
- **Reproducibility**: Document any dependencies or data preprocessing steps within the notebook so that others can reproduce your results easily.

## Best Practices

- **Separation of Concerns**: Use notebooks for experimentation and exploratory work, while keeping production code in the `src/` directory. Once you've finalized an approach in a notebook, convert the code into reusable scripts or modules.
- **Data Handling**: Reference data stored in the `data/` directory to ensure consistency. Do not store large datasets within notebooks themselves.
- **Collaboration**: Encourage team members to add their own notebooks and share insights, using markdown and code cells to explain their findings.

## Example Notebook Description

When adding a new notebook, include a brief description of its purpose in markdown cells at the top of the file. For example:

```plaintext
Notebook: network_traffic_analysis.ipynb
Purpose: Perform exploratory data analysis on network traffic logs to identify anomalous patterns and suspicious activity.
Dataset: Stored in `data/raw/network_logs.csv`.
```
