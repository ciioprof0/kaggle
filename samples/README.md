# samples/

The `samples/` directory is intended for storing example data, code snippets, or templates that demonstrate how to use various components of the project. These samples provide guidance to users and contributors, helping them understand how to interact with the project, whether through code, data processing, or application configuration.

## Purpose

The `samples/` directory serves as a resource for storing example files that demonstrate the proper usage of the project's functionality. These can include sample datasets, code snippets, configuration files, or test cases. The goal is to provide users with starting points or reference materials that make it easier to understand and work with the project.

## Usage Examples

### Cyber Operations

- **Sample Network Traffic Data**: Provide example network traffic logs (in anonymized form) that can be used to test network monitoring tools or intrusion detection systems.
- **Configuration Templates**: Offer example configuration files for security tools like firewalls or intrusion detection systems, which users can modify based on their environment.

### Intelligence and Information Operations

- **Sample Text Corpora**: Include small, sanitized text corpora that users can utilize to test NLP models such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or topic modeling.
- **Language Model Inputs**: Provide example inputs and expected outputs for NLP tasks, such as a sentence or document to be analyzed, with annotations or classifications to demonstrate expected model behavior.

### Data Science Applications

- **Sample Datasets**: Include small, clean datasets in formats like CSV or JSON to show how to properly format data for analysis or model training.
- **Preprocessing Examples**: Offer code snippets or scripts that demonstrate how to preprocess raw data (e.g., data cleaning, feature extraction) before feeding it into machine learning models.
- **Model Testing Inputs**: Provide test cases or sample inputs to verify the functionality of models or algorithms in the project.

## Structure

Organize the `samples/` directory to make it easy for users to find relevant examples:

```plaintext
samples/
├── data/              # Sample datasets or corpora
├── configs/           # Sample configuration files
├── code/              # Sample scripts or code snippets
└── README.md          # This readme file
```

### Suggested Subdirectories

- **`data/`**: Store small, well-structured example datasets that demonstrate the expected input format for the project.
- **`configs/`**: Include configuration files used in the project (e.g., `.yaml`, `.json`) to guide users on how to configure the system.
- **`code/`**: Provide code snippets or templates that demonstrate how to use key features of the project, such as data loading, processing, or model inference.

## Guidelines

- **Data Anonymization**: Ensure any sample data is anonymized and free of sensitive or private information. Use synthetic data where necessary.
- **Simplicity**: Keep examples simple and easy to follow. The goal is to provide clear, understandable guidance for new users.
- **Clarity**: Add comments to any code samples or configuration files to explain their purpose and functionality.
- **Format Consistency**: Ensure that sample files follow the format required by the application, making it easy for users to plug in their own data or configurations.

## Best Practices

- **Documentation**: Always provide explanations or comments within your samples to make their usage clear. You can either embed explanations directly in code or configuration files or include markdown documentation within the `samples/` directory.
- **Keep Samples Small**: Use minimal datasets and code examples to prevent unnecessary bloat. These samples should be lightweight and easy to test.
- **Encourage Reuse**: Samples should be designed so users can quickly adapt them for their own use cases with minimal modifications.

## Example File Descriptions

For each file or set of files, include a description of its purpose and how to use it. For example:

```plaintext
Sample File: data/sample_network_logs.csv
Purpose: This is a small, anonymized dataset of network traffic logs for use in testing the network monitoring tool. The dataset includes IP addresses, connection timestamps, and packet sizes.
Usage: Load this dataset into the analysis tool to test its ability to detect anomalies in network traffic.
```
