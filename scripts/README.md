# scripts/

The `scripts/` directory is intended for storing utility scripts used in the project. These scripts can automate tasks such as setup, deployment, data processing, and testing. They are typically auxiliary to the main codebase, providing support for various operations and workflows throughout the project.

## Purpose

The `scripts/` directory houses any helper or automation scripts that aid in project development, maintenance, or execution. These scripts can be written in a variety of languages, such as Bash, Python, or PowerShell, and are designed to simplify repetitive tasks, such as environment setup, data processing, or running tests.

## Usage Examples

### Cyber Operations

- **Network Setup Scripts**: Include scripts to automate the setup of a virtual network or configure firewalls and intrusion detection systems in a test environment.
- **Security Tool Automation**: Provide scripts that automate the execution of security tools (e.g., vulnerability scanners, log parsers) across different environments.

### Intelligence and Information Operations

- **Data Preprocessing**: Include scripts that automate the process of cleaning and preparing raw text corpora for NLP models. These scripts can handle tokenization, lemmatization, and other text preprocessing tasks.
- **Model Training and Inference**: Provide scripts that simplify the training and inference of NLP models, such as sentiment analysis or named entity recognition tasks, by automating data loading, model execution, and result saving.

### Data Science Applications

- **Dataset Preparation**: Provide scripts that automate the transformation of raw datasets into formats suitable for analysis or machine learning model training.
- **Automated Testing**: Include testing scripts that verify the correctness of models, algorithms, or data processing pipelines, running predefined tests and saving results.

## Structure

Organize the `scripts/` directory by the type of tasks the scripts perform:

```plaintext
scripts/
├── setup.sh            # Script to set up the project environment
├── data_processing.py  # Script to preprocess data for analysis
├── deploy.sh           # Script to deploy the application
└── README.md           # This readme file
```

### Suggested Script Types

- **`setup.sh`**: Automate the installation of dependencies and the configuration of the development environment.
- **`data_processing.py`**: A Python script to clean, transform, or preprocess data before analysis or model training.
- **`deploy.sh`**: A deployment script for automating the build and deployment of the application to a production or testing environment.
- **`test_runner.sh`**: A script to run unit tests, integration tests, or other validation processes.

## Guidelines

- **Portability**: Ensure scripts are cross-platform or clearly specify the operating system they are intended to run on (e.g., Unix-based systems for Bash scripts or Windows for PowerShell scripts).
- **Documentation**: Add comments within each script to explain its purpose, usage, and key steps. Additionally, document any dependencies or prerequisites.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear and descriptive names for each script, indicating its purpose (e.g., `setup.sh`, `test_runner.sh`, `data_processing.py`).
- **Parameterization**: Allow users to customize the behavior of scripts using command-line arguments or environment variables where applicable.

## Example Script Description

For each script, provide a brief description in the script file or in a top-level `README.md` file. For example:

```plaintext
Script: setup.sh
Purpose: This Bash script automates the installation of project dependencies and configures the development environment. It checks for required packages, installs missing ones, and configures environment variables.
Usage: Run the script using `bash scripts/setup.sh` from the project root directory.
```

## Best Practices

- **Version Control**: Commit only useful and well-documented scripts to version control. Avoid committing one-off or temporary scripts that may confuse other contributors.
- **Modularity**: Where possible, write scripts in a modular way so that individual components can be reused in different contexts.
- **Testing**: Test scripts across multiple environments or platforms to ensure they function as expected.
