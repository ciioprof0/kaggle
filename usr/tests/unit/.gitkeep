File Purpose: To ensure that Git/GitHub tracks this otherwise empty directory.
Git does not track empty directories, so we include this optional file so that
directory structure is tracked in version control. This file is normally blank.
This explanatory note is for those who are unfamiliar with the .gitkeep file.
You may delete this note if you wish. It will not effect Git/GitHub functionality.
