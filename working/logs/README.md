# logs/

This directory is designated for storing logs generated by the application during runtime. These logs can provide valuable insights into the application's behavior, assist with debugging, and monitor system performance.

## Purpose

The `logs/` directory serves as the location for storing logs created by your code, such as error logs, execution traces, or performance metrics. Logs are crucial for tracking issues, analyzing system behavior, and ensuring that the application runs smoothly.

## Structure

You can organize the `logs/` directory by creating subdirectories or grouping logs based on specific modules or components within your application:

```plaintext
logs/
├── app.log           # General application log
├── error.log         # Log for application errors
├── performance.log   # Log for tracking performance metrics
└── README.md         # This readme file
```

### Suggested Log Files

- **`app.log`**: General log file that tracks application activity, including important events and execution flows.
- **`error.log`**: File dedicated to logging application errors, exceptions, and failures for debugging purposes.
- **`performance.log`**: Logs performance-related data such as response times, resource usage, and other metrics that can help optimize the system.

## Usage Examples

### Cyber Operations

- **Network Monitoring Logs**: Store logs generated by tools that monitor network traffic or detect security breaches, capturing details such as connection attempts and traffic patterns.
- **Intrusion Detection Logs**: Keep logs that track suspicious activities detected by intrusion detection systems (IDS) developed within the application.

### Intelligence and Information Operations

- **NLP Model Logs**: Capture logs generated by NLP models or HLT applications, including data preprocessing steps, model training progress, and evaluation results.
- **Sentiment Analysis Logs**: Track the results of sentiment analysis tasks, such as polarity scores or key trends in analyzed datasets.

### Data Science Applications

- **Data Processing Logs**: Log each step of data processing pipelines, including file read/write operations, data cleaning, and transformations.
- **Model Training Logs**: Track training progress for machine learning models, including metrics such as loss values, accuracy, and validation results over time.

## Guidelines

- **Log Rotation**: Implement log rotation to prevent the accumulation of excessively large log files. Old logs can be archived or deleted periodically to manage storage efficiently.
- **Log Content**: Ensure logs only contain non-sensitive information. Avoid logging personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data unless necessary and compliant with privacy regulations.
- **Access Control**: Limit access to logs to ensure that they are available only to authorized users for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## External Logs

Any logs generated outside the application (such as external system logs or third-party service logs) that are processed by the application should be stored in the `data/` directory, not in `logs/`.

## Best Practices

- **Log Format**: Use a consistent log format (e.g., JSON or plain text) to make logs easier to parse and analyze.
- **Timestamps**: Include timestamps in all log entries to track when events occur.
- **Log Levels**: Use different log levels such as `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `DEBUG` to distinguish between types of messages and allow for filtered log viewing.
